[Islands](https://islands-94307.web.app)

Islands was the first project I built when I was learning how to code. I thought it would just be a cool way for me to learn the Javascript language and how to use the React framework, but it evolved into a really complete full stack project where I learned:
- ui, react, html/css
- apis, servers, express, websockets
- database design, sqlite, postgres
- user auth, firebase
- webscraping
- hosting projects, static sites vs interactive
