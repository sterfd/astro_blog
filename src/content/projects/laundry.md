<!-- [Stef's Website](https://nkmt.netlify.app) -->

I was really excited about sharing what I've been learning at RC, so I built this website to start blogging, keep track of things I'm interested in, and showcase my projects. I considered a few different static site generators, but Astro seemed pretty cool since you can use as bunch of different JS libraries
- ui, react, html/css
- apis, servers, express, websockets
- database design, sqlite, postgres
- user auth, firebase
- webscraping
- hosting projects, static sites vs interactive
