The RC doorbot unlocks the RC space for active Recursers. I made updates to the web server so personal access tokens can be used for authentication along with OAuth. This allows for mobile apps and iOS shortcuts to connect to doorbot. I built a mobile app for Android using React Native to access Doorbot, as well as a series of [iOS shortcuts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b2cdb4aebefb48b78ad360d06a92b05a).
