[Stef's Website](https://nkmt.netlify.app)

I was really excited about sharing what I've been learning at RC, so I built this website to start blogging, keep track of things I'm interested in, and showcase my projects. I considered a few different static site generators, but Astro seemed pretty cool since you can use as bunch of different JS libraries
