Obligatory hello world! I'm currently half way through my 12 week batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in Brooklyn and it's been seriously amazing. I think I'll need a bit of time after leaving to be able to process this experience and put it into words, but so far, I like to describe it as the promise of sunshine and rainbows that grad school likes gives you. I get to choose what I want to learn and work on, and I get to do it with people who are incredibly kind, accomplished, and intelligent. There's a strong culture of learning generously and sharing openly, which is one of the reasons why I'm starting to blog. 

I want to document some of the things I've had a chance to get my feet wet with, and continue to do so with the things I'll learn in the future.
