I just finished my 6 week extension to my original 12 weeks at RC... And I didn't work ony my website or blog at all. It felt really tough to keep this as a top priority when I had a lot of other projects, pairing, and socializing to keep on top of. I worked on some projects that I was really excited about, and even finished the Doorbot App stuff, so I think that is pretty good motivation to start writing about what I've worked on. This will get updated soon.
