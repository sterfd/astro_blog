1) write actual blog posts lmao
1) fix the animations - this is really gaudy - either remove them completely or find nicer ones
1) project layout for project page - also think about distinction between a project making blog post vs the project page itself
1) get headers in blog posts to have different styles - inherit from blog/thought/project to markdown/baselayout
1) what am i going to do with the tags? hmm
1) figure out if this layout is what i want in the end. maybe a sidebar navigation is nicer
