                My name is Stef. I was a scientist, but I've fallen in
                love with programming, and trying to learn as much as I can
                about it! I enjoy making things (web/app development), playing with
                things (automation, datasets, ML models), and breaking things (cryptography, CTF).
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a reminder to myself to write about things or tutorials for my
                future self. Sometimes I learn how to use a nifty tool or do a
                cool thing, and I'll forget everything about it the next time I
                need it ;A; My memory is truly goldfish sized. 
            </p>

                Outside of coding, I love playing and watching a bunch of
                sports: volleyball, climbing, cycling. I will stay up all night playing board games if you invite me to. 
                Shoot me an email to connect!
